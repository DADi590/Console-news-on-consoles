# Console news on consoles
Check the most recent console jailbreaking news

## To open the news webpage:
### On a PS3:
#### For HAN, HEN or CFW:
- Use Console news on consoles installer for HEN and CFW --> NOT READY YET.
#### For HAN (or CFW):
- Install HAN Toolbox 0.9 Unofficial or newer (https://github.com/DADi590/HAN-Toolbox-Unofficial/releases), which comes with What's New on Browser which shows the PSX-Place/PS3 page.

### On PSVita or newer:
Just come to this webpage: https://dadi590.github.io/Console-news-on-consoles/ (I think they're supposed to be able to load the page normally).

### On a PSP:
Not available (yet?).

### On a PS1 or PS2:
How is this supposed to go on a console which doesn't have a browser? XD
