## To open the news webpage:
### On a PS3:
#### For HAN:
- Install HAN Toolbox 0.9 Unofficial or newer (https://github.com/DADi590/HAN-Toolbox-Unofficial/releases), which comes with What's New on Browser which shows the PS3 page.
#### For HAN, HEN or CFW:
- Use Console news on consoles installer for HEN and CFW --> NOT READY YET.

### On any other PlayStation (except PSP):
Just come to this webpage: https://dadi590.github.io/Console-news-on-consoles/, which I think it's supposed to work on a PSVita, PS4 and PS5 (I don't own any of these, so I can't be sure).

### On a PSP, not available (yet?)
