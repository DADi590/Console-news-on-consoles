Also it's worth checking out at the download location (link below) the additional info and ":how to" information pertaining to use of REBUG LITE's CFW functionality. Note: that currently as of writing this some homebrew still needs to catch up fully for 4.86 support to on par with 4.85 and previous FW's . So  it's not advised to rush in quite yet, if some bugs discourage you,. Until then, keep a watch  <a href="https://www.psx-place.com/threads/4-86-ofw-released-4-86-custom-firmware-ps3hen-apps-tools-updates.28806/" class="internalLink"><span style="color: #b30000"><b>HERE</b></span></a> as those updates roll through, since there was no kernel changes to the 4.86 update most homebrew should still be functional on 4.86 with no update but some could have minor/moderate issues.​</div><br/><br/></dadi590_description>
